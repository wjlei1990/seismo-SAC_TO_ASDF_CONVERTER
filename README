This program is used to convert SAC file to ASDF file using Parallel ASDF I/O API.

Developer: Wenjie Lei(lei@princeton.edu); James Smith(jas11@princeton.edu)

Bug report: email either of the guys listed above. They will be more than happy to see the problems. Another way is report the bug in github issue:( http://github.com/wjlei1990/seismo-SAC_TO_ASDF_CONVERTER/issues)

Dependency:
Adios-1.5.0
RESP files are needed if you wish to store the response in the ASDF container.
These can be obtained from IRIS: http://service.iris.edu/irisws/resp/1/

Run the example:
1. Copy PAR_FILE.test to PAR_FILE
    cp PAR_FILE.test PAR_FILE
2. Compile the code
    make clean; make
3. Run the code
    ./sac_to_asdf
4. See the result
    You should be able to see the asdf file: 200912100230A_obs.sac.bp
    bpls -l 200912100230A_obs.sac.bp

How to use:
1. set up the "PAR_FILE" in the home(the home of the code) directory, which includes:
  a) DEBUG: debug mode
  b) event_name
  c) DATA_FILE_DIRECTORY
  d) DATA_FILE_SUFFIX
  e) STORE_RESPONSE

2. make clean ; make

3. ./sac_to_asdf

Notes:
1. The code uses Parallel ASDF I/O API. But now the converter only works on one processor. Since now the ASDF I/O API is independent of number of processors, so do not worry about the converted file won't work on parallel way(if you use the same Parellel ASDF I/O API)

2. You can find complete Parallel ASDF I/O API in src/asdf_subs.f90. If you want to use these API, include the file in your source code.
